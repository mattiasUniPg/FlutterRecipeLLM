# cookingnf

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## STEP
flutter create my_app ;
## FIREBASE NOT IMPLEMENTED
flutter pub add firebase_auth ; flutter pub add firebase_database ;
## IMPORT PACKAGES
import 'package:firebase_auth/firebase_auth.dart'; import 'package:firebase_database/firebase_database.dart';
## INITIALIZE FIREBASE
FirebaseAuth.instance.initialize(); FirebaseDatabase.instance.initialize();

organization 

## SQL SUPABASE
create table recipes (
  id uuid default uuid_generate_v4() primary key,
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  title text not null,
  ingredients text[] not null,
  instructions text[] not null,
  is_public boolean default false,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default now()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
alter table recipes enable row level security;

-- Create policies
create policy "Users can insert their own recipes"
  on recipes for insert
  with check (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "Users can update their own recipes"
  on recipes for update
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "Users can delete their own recipes"
  on recipes for delete
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "Users can read their own recipes"
  on recipes for select
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "Anyone can read public recipes"
  on recipes for select
  using (is_public = true);

## REVIEW
To make the application easily deployable:

1. For the frontend, you can use Vercel, which provides seamless deployment for Next.js applications. Simply connect your GitHub repository to Vercel, and it will automatically deploy your app whenever you push changes to the main branch.
2. For the backend, you can use a platform like Heroku or DigitalOcean App Platform. These platforms allow you to deploy Node.js applications with minimal configuration.


To connect the frontend and backend:

1. Deploy the backend to your chosen platform.
2. Create a `.env.local` file in your frontend project with the backend URL:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
3. Update the frontend API calls to use the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable (which we've already done in the code above).


To further improve the UI and UX:

1. Implement a loading state for API calls using a skeleton loader or spinner.
2. Add form validation for better user feedback.
3. Implement error handling and display error messages to users.
4. Add a confirmation dialog before deleting recipes.
5. Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for the recipe lists.
6. Add a search functionality to filter recipes.
7. Implement a dark mode toggle for user preference.


Remember to thoroughly test your application and implement proper security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to ensure a robust and secure user experience.

This implementation provides a solid foundation for your recipe management web app with a strong emphasis on UI and UX. It's responsive, easily deployable, and includes all the required features.
